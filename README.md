Chattr is a free online platform for chatting about anything you love! Users can create a account and use it to chat with other users. The app has multiple topics, each having one chat, making the experience feel like you're chatting with friends.

Chattr includes following features:

-Multiple chats (topics), that can be added and modified by admins.
-Users  that have signed in can send and read messages in the chats.
-Users can create an account and sign in using a password.
-Users can add a profile picture.
-Users can have a admin status, that gives the moderator abilities (removing messages, accounts, etc.)
-There is a search function. Users can search for messages containing a spesific word.
-Users can modify and remove their own messages.
-Users can give likes to messages.

4.8. UPDATE:

- The application can't be run or tested yet because of problem with SQLAlchemy. I've been trying to write as many functions as I can without trying the app.
- I hope I'll get the SQLalchemy problem fixed soon with some help so I can actually start developing the app.
- Some of the basic functions such as login, getting the topics and the messages are somewhat done.
- Basic structure of the project is clear.
